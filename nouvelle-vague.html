  <article class='content'>
    <p>Nouvelle Vague is a project I worked on for ultranoir, It offers a
poetic and interactive real-time 3D experience based on Twitter. In a
minimalist and surrealist world, Tweets are carried out with different
flying objects from the borders of the scene to the center where stands
the ultranoir black statue (tweets are retrieved from your selected
hashtag).</p>
<p>Flying objects are air balloons, biplane, UFOs, zeppelins, balloons.
Each has its own speed and specific paths. The user can select any of
these ships to take advantage of the pilotâ€™s view and explore the scene.
In this post I will explain how we made it.</p>

( after the video intro ). If your browser does not support webgl you
can watch a <a href="http://youtu.be/HxUwJ_iPdNc">video version on youtube</a></p>
<h2>Scene</h2>
<p>We wanted to have vehicles coming from mountain/sky to the statue and
leave a tweet. We did not want to manage vehicle collisions, after a
while, we decided to organize scene and vehicles animations like the
picture below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/animation_row0.jpg" title="animation_row0" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/animation_row1.jpg" title="animation_row1" /></p>
<p>The idea is to avoid vehicles to penetrate each other, for this we
constrained each vehicle in a 'row' in which the animation will be
played (off course the animation must be setup to fit in that virtual
row). Doing this we minimized collision between vehicles but we knew it
will not be 100% perfect and sometime you could see artifact near the
statue.</p>
<p>Animation's vehicle were played in loop mode. To add a bit of randomness
I added a random delay at the beginning of a new loop to avoid vehicles
to be synchronized together (eyes are very good to detect those
pattern).
Animations were made using blender and to make it work with
<a href="https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs/">osgjs</a> I had to update it to support keyframes
container from osg, it also means that now the osgjs
plugin for osg is able to export osgAnimation
data. Why using this workflow ? In all my project I use
<a href="https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg">OpenSceneGraph</a> as a swiss
knife, then I export data from osg to osgjs.</p>
<h2>Drawing Texts</h2>
<p>The text and logo on the ground were displayed using distance map. When
you have vector shape with closed shape like text/logo it's more
efficient to use distance map instead of classical texture mapping. The
advantage is that you can use less texture size and with better result
than just bitmap. To do this you have to convert your original texture
into a new one (distance map) then you use a 'special' shader to display
it in realtime. Below you can see picture from the <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">Valve
paper</a>,
both image are at the same resolution.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/valve_0.png" title="valve_0" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/valve_12.png" title="valve_1" /></p>
<p>(Pictures from valve paper)</p>
<p>The only problem I had was for the big text/logo in center of the scene,
even with distance map I had aliasing because of the static 'edge size'
in the shader.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">edgeSize</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">edgeSize</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">smoothstep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">end</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">color</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To fix this, I adapted the 'edgeSize' depending on the camera position,
it's more a hack to fix aliasing than a real fix.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>We implemented 2 cameras, one for the center of the scene to watch the
statue and tweets and one in each vehicles. Camera in vehicles was more
tricky because vehicles comes and back with the tweets. In the beginning
I had a simple lookat camera that was located in the vehicle but looked
to the statue. It worked but not really interesting, we wanted to be in
the plane and see the looping. To do that I changed the camera to fps
one. To tune camera and let the artist configure them, I added offset
connected to html sliders.
Good but vehicles came in and went back after bringing their tweets, so
the problem was that we were seeing an empty screen (the mountain) when
the vehicles returned to their original position. We resolved this by
changing the camera from 'in vehicle' to the camera 'look to the statue
from the vehicle'.
Finally for automatic mode we improved the camera to select the best
camera available. It meant that we checked for each vehicles the time in
their animation, and select the vehicles that has a time in 'good'
range. Off course we had to tune the range for each animations of
vehicles. You can see below the differents event in timeline for a
vehicles.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/02/timeline_0.jpg" title="timeline_0" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/02/timeline_1.jpg" title="timeline_1" /></p>
<p><em>Delay Random</em>: random time before playing vehicle animation.
<em>Leave tweet</em>: time when the tweet box leave the vehicle and play the
transition animation.
<em>Camera cut</em>: when the vehicle start to go back, we cut to watch the
statue and tweets.
<em>Camera invalid</em>: camera invalid means the vehicle can't be selected
when the camera switch to a new one</p>
<h2>Shadow</h2>
<p>The ground was a plane so I took advantage of this to use flat textured
quad that followed the position of the vehicle but at 0 in z. Shadow
textures were generated by the artist then converted to distance map and
finally used on the quad. We used distance map on those texture because
it gave more control, for example the blur of the edge. It worked on
most vehicles except for the plane because of its animations (the shadow
would not follow the plane rotation). To fix this I used a matrix that
project the shape of the plane onto the ground. Using this method meant
no soft edges for shadow plus some artifact due to blending. Deadline
make us to fix it later.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/shadow_issue.jpg" title="shadow_issue" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/shadow_issue2.jpg" title="shadow_issue2" /></p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs">shadow
example</a> in
<a href="https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs">osgjs</a> that explains differents shadow techniques.</p>
<h2>Transitions</h2>
<p>To make the tweets going from vehicles to the statue, we had to make a
transition. I wanted to try something like disolving the tweet box to a
lot of smaller cubes and then moved them like they are transported by
wind to the statue.
I first setup the effect <a href="https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs">on this
page</a> and then improved it
with a fake wind like in the
<a href="demo/demojs-fff/">demojs-fff</a>. To finish I added a
simple fade out when cubes are near the statue and voila.
The effect was not optimized and I used one 3d model per cube, that
would be better to use pseudo instancied cube or pack all cube into one
model and passing transformation to the shader with attributes or
uniforms, again time...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/transition_0.jpg" title="transition_0" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/transition_1.jpg" title="transition_1" /></p>
<h2>Clouds</h2>
<p>I wanted to try volumetric clouds on this project. For this I tried
different method</p>
<ul>
<li>mega particles (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QqD26SXWDc">youtube
    video</a>). Because of the
    shower doors effect I dropped this method after a few tries.</li>
<li><a href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch39.html">3d volume
    textures</a>,
    I started but I needed more time to implement it. The idea was to
    generate a 3d texture based on noise function then in realtime draw
    slice to represent the volume. I will try to release an example
    later.</li>
<li>Particles based. Like particles you draw different textured sprite
    with transparency. In this case you have to sort sprite from the
    camera position and render with blending enabled. I used this method
    because of time and it worked enough. On screenshots below you can
    see some test with tuning parameters of clouds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>One of the most important aspect when I worked on this project was how
we setup and tuned effects. I wrote scripts to export 3d models,
generate
<a href="https://github.com/cedricpinson/DistanceMapGenerator">distancemap</a> as
usual, but the new tool I wrote for this project was to integrate
automatic slider generation from shader parameters. To do this, I wrote
functions that were able to check variable and type in shaders and from
those informations created html slider elements that communicated
directly with the shaders. To let artists tune effect and focus only on
the desired effects I added and not think if they could lose or not
their work, I saved value with localstorage. When artists were happy
with the result they sent me by mail the value then I added their value
as 'defaults' value. This process could be improved in futur with undo
and save set of parameters, but even without that it was really
convenient to let artist worked this way. You can see on the screenshot
below the sliders used to fine tune the rendering effects.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/2012/01/sliders.jpg" title="sliders" /></p>
<p>You can try the <a href="demo/nouvellevague/">developer
version</a> and play with sliders</p>
